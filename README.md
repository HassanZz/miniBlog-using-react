The aim of this project is to create a mini blog that allows users to create, remove, update, and delete (CRUD) their blogs.
The project have used json-server as the server and React as the front end of the project.

## in this project I used:
* Several components to create a single page application( SPA).
* Json-server as server of the blog.
* React Hooks( like useParams, useState, useHistory)
* React router to address the weblog pages, and switch between them. 
* Modern javaScript features( like arrow functions, ...)
* ...
